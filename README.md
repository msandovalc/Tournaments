# Tournaments

Software for planning and keeping score of tournaments in various formats.

## Vision

Tournaments will be able to plot a tournament in multiple formats and keep the scores for teams or players.

Tournaments should be able to provide random seeding, history, presets and maybe even tournament prediction.

All of this should be packaged in nice and easy-to-understand interface.

## Problem

The problem Tournaments will solve is providing accessible and easy way to keep track of tournaments in various sports.

## Resources

Tournaments will most probably be built with React and other JavaScript and HTML frameworks to make it beautiful.
