# Tournaments

Software for planning and keeping score of tournaments in various formats.

## Vision

Tournaments will be able to plot a tournament in multiple formats and keep the scores for teams or players.

Tournaments should be able to provide random seeding, history, presets and maybe even tournament prediction.

All of this should be packaged in nice and easy-to-understand interface.

## Problem

The problem Tournaments will solve is providing accessible and easy way to keep track of tournaments in various sports.

## Resources

Tournaments will most probably be built with React and other JavaScript and HTML frameworks to make it beautiful.

## Tournament systems

### Swiss-system 

A Swiss-system tournament is a non-eliminating tournament format which features a set number of rounds of competition. Each competitor (team or individual) does not play every other. Competitors meet one-to-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but not the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds. All competitors play in each round unless there is an odd number of players.

### Round-robin 

A round-robin tournament (or all-play-all tournament) is a competition in which each contestant meets all other contestants in turn.

### Elimination

Elimination tournament is divided into successive rounds; each competitor plays in at least one fixture per round. The top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next round. As rounds progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases. The final round, usually known as the final or cup final, consists of just one fixture; the winner of which is the overall champion.

### Group ranking system

In a group tournament, unlike a knockout tournament, there is no scheduled decisive final match. Instead, all the competitors are ranked by examining the results of all the matches played in the tournament. Typically, points are awarded for each match,[n 1] with competitors ranked based either on total number of points or average points per match. Usually each competitor finishes with an equal number of matches, in which case rankings by total points and by average points are equivalent at the end of the tournament, though not necessarily while it is in progress.
